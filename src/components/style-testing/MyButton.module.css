/* We could think that because we are into a MyButton.module.css, this code is specific to the component (MyButton) that imports this stylesheet.
However, the :global class allows us to modify Autogenerated MUI classes but with the global scope. Every .MuiButton-root will a the color red.
Finally, it is equivalent of modifying directly .MuiButton-root into a global css, MyButton.css for example */

/* Doesn't works as we could expect - ChatGPT says it works */

/* Works but not optimal - equivalent to .css */

/* Doesn't works too - ChatGPT says it works */
