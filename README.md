# Explore Nations

This project is a website that lists countries around the world with different information. It was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

React is used for the front-end. Countries are retrieved from the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com/).

There is also an interactive map. The [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) and [React Leaflet](https://react-leaflet.js.org/) packages are used to integrate the map.

Boundaries of each countries are displayed using GeoJSON data from [https://datahub.io/core/geo-countries](https://datahub.io/core/geo-countries).

If you want to know what is the distribution of countries in each region and continent, you can look into the [generated-countries-all-sorted.json](/src/scripts/generated-countries-all-sorted.json) file that was generated by [script-countries-all.js](/src/scripts/script-countries-all.js).

This project is actually a Minimun Viable Product. 

Here's the link to the deployed site: https://portfolio-explore-nations.web.app/.
